	abstract = {Although computers can represent a medium for children's social and intellectual development, some researchers believe that using computers before age seven subtracts from important developmental tasks and other types of learning. Those opposed to computers believe that computer-based activities are less effective in developing understanding and skills than are artifacts that young children can handle. These anxieties extend to technologies such as smart toys. Our recently completed research project, Computers and Children's Electronic Toys, investigated how children use smart toys. Cachet combines recent interest in mobile learning, tangible interfaces, and the home use of technologies. This research aimed mainly to explore interactivity and interfaces in the context of smart toys that children could use alone or in conjunction with a computer.},

Cutting-edge display technologies have taken a major role in human-toy interaction. In particular, reality-virtuality technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) have been adopted in digital entertainment and physical toys. With advances of portable and wearable devices, reality-virtuality technologies have become more popular and immersed into our daily life. Various interaction techniques are identified such as depth sensors and haptic devices. We will introduce example technologies, devices and products of the above technologies. However, displayed/projected virtual objects cannot give the user a sense of touch. Additional apparatus such as haptic styli are necessary to interact with the virtual objects. We foresee that in the near future, more kinds of virtual senses (such as taste) could be simulated and become part of the toy.},

	abstract = {Global sales of traditional toys such as dolls, action figures, and role-play games are either flat or shrinking. One of the main reasons for the slow or negative growth of sales is the increase in internet and console-based video gaming across multiple devices and platforms. Faced with this disruptive force, traditional toy makers are increasingly trying to develop toys that incorporate interactivity through software integration and mobile interconnectivity. Though the idea of creating this synergy between traditional toy hardware and emerging mobile/internet connectivity is a no-brainer, the success of such integration depends on understanding the market fundamentals of hardware and software complementarity. The responses of the toy industry thus far have been ineffective in stopping the decline of sales. This paper takes a closer look at the issue by conducting a brief survey of the traditional toy industry and trying to identify the key drivers of success and failure of such toys. We then use a few tools of marketing research to explain how traditional toy makers can leverage information and mobile technologies to re-establish themselves in a sustainable growth path.},

Although spatialized sound can provide an added dimension for such devices, one of the reasons that it is often overlooked is the complexity involved in its generation. Spatialized sound generation is not trivial, particularly when considering mobile devices and toys with their limited computational capabilities, single miniature loudspeaker and limited battery power. This chapter provides an overview of sound and spatial sound for use in human-computer interfaces with a particular emphasis on its use in mobile devices and toys. A brief review outlining several sound-based mobile applications, toys, and spatial sound generation is provided. The problems and limitations associated with sound capture and output on mobile devices is discussed along with an overview of potential solutions to these problems. The chapter concludes with an overview of several novel applications for sound on mobile devices and toys.},

	abstract = {A toy is a product that is intended for play. Common examples of toys include dolls, board games and video games. Based on the reports from the 110th Annual American International Toy Fair, toy manufacturers are increasingly incorporating mobile applications into their products through smartphones. This technological advancement gives users the opportunity to augment the physical world as they play through a user interface of information services. These toys capture the user’s physical activity state (e.g., walking, standing, running, etc.) and store personalized information (e.g., location, activity pattern, etc.) through the mobile device. By adding a digital component onto an analog device, a greater potential for a more personalized and dynamic play experience, such as augmented reality, is unlocked. In addition, this play experience can be further modified after point of sale through a developer’s content or update release through their digital service. As smartphones and mobile applications play a larger role in the everyday lives of their users, toy manufacturers commonly face the challenge of better understanding the modern consumer’s needs as well as their concerns. Issues such as privacy and data encryption, which were not common problems in the toy industry, are suddenly becoming necessary due to these trends. This book chapter also discusses a case study of toy guns in Brazil.},

The toy industry has also issued regulations for toy safety; however these regulations have no mention of privacy. While parents aim to protect the privacy of their children, we investigate the unique requirements of end users.

The survey involved 313 participants, of which about 44 \% were older adults and elderly users. The results showed that the use of aids to support the interaction of older adults with the web promotes improvements in the interaction of older adults and younger users alike, which supports the argument for enhanced universal usability. Finally, it was possible to diagnose barriers that still remain and which aids had best acceptance by older adults.},

	abstract = {Brazilian senescent population can grow three times the actual number in the next 20 years [18], being over 88 million people in 2035. This senescent growing number brings new challenges on quality of life for Brazilian society. How to promote digital inclusion to this profile of user is still a challenge in the literature. We believe that a social network focused on senescent users can enhance the digital inclusion for them. However, it's essential that the social network be designed for senescent users. This study aims to create a project with this characteristics. We analyzed a successful social network (WhatsApp) in order to propose a new one (Florch) for senescent users. We developed a high fidelity prototype of Florch and tested it. Our findings show usability and accessibility problems faced on the project's development. In addition, a Hierarchical Task Analysis of our social network showed that it has less and simpler tasks than the successful social network (WhatsApp).},
